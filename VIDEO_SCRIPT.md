Welcome to Privacy Training Record Tracker, a revolutionary FHEVM example that reimagines how organizations manage sensitive training data on blockchain.

Traditional systems expose all training records publicly. But what if employee completion status could remain completely private while still being verifiable on-chain?

Introducing our solution powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Imagine a training management system where completion status stays encrypted at all times - even while the smart contract processes it. Only authorized employees can decrypt their own records.

Let me show you how it works.

First, an administrator connects their wallet and deploys the contract. Training modules are created: Data Privacy Fundamentals, GDPR Compliance, Security Awareness, and Incident Response.

A trainer then creates a training record for an employee. The record is immediately created with encrypted completion status using FHEVM's ebool data type.

Next, when training is completed, the trainer marks it as done. This triggers encrypted storage of the completion status on-chain. The data is completely encrypted - no one can read it except authorized parties.

The employee connects their wallet and views their personal training records. The encrypted completion status is decrypted only for them, showing their training progress securely.

Here's what makes this powerful: the blockchain stores all records immutably, but sensitive data remains encrypted. It's privacy at the protocol level, not just at the application level.

Behind the scenes, advanced cryptography ensures that only the contract and authorized users can ever access the true completion status. The blockchain provides transparency and immutability, while FHE provides genuine privacy.

Privacy Training Record Tracker demonstrates enterprise-grade privacy preservation for the Web3 era. Whether you are building compliance systems, healthcare applications, or educational platforms - FHEVM gives you the tools to maintain privacy while leveraging blockchain's power.
